# Why this exists
I made this base16 builder because all the builders I tried only considered files with the ".yaml" extension as schemes, leaving out ".yml", which meant that some schemes were not built. This builder solves those problems.

it doesn't follow the specification.

UPDATE: This is trash, don't use it. Use something else.
